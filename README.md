# This is a work in progress (no auth to share newest version yet)
This is a work in progress and we are not yet authorized to share the newest code online for this project, since we still have to discuss the success rate of later iterations and wether the code should be available online, opening us up for exploits. 
The main task of this is to provide better understanding of candidates to our casting team right of the get go and find clear no's in our application process like wrong dates. 

# Current Public Version: 

# Simple Semantic Match Proof of Concept -> matches Candidates Profile with Dormitory Description

# Massmann Bot might also be shared soon -> same concept applies we can't publish until concerns of abuse are put aside
